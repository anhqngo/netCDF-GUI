Motivation
************

The Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) is an open-source community
software facility for ensemble data assimilation developed at the National
Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The DART distribution includes MATLAB
diagnostic tools that examine the differences between observed values and
predicted values from a model.

The output for these diagnostic tools are netCDF files containing ensemble
values and relevant metadata. The cross-platform DART Viewer application is
designed to help users quickly visualize those output files to understand their
model performance and assimilation process.

Features
*********

- 2D and 3D scatter plot
- Subset the dataset with respect to geolocation
- Subset the dataset with respect to predefined groups
- Basic database query functionalities

*Note: DART Viewer only works with DART output netCDF files. To visualize other
types of netCDF files, please use other tools like Panoply or IDV.*

Requirements
============
- Python 3 and pip
- PROJ4



Building
=========
Download the binary installation file. Since I do not own a Mac Development
license, users might need to go to setting and trust to open the applications.
